Nov 28, 2016
	Yesterday : No work was done until today, as I was busy with personal events.
	Today     : I completed a large portion of the save function. Currently I can produce a general output for every shape created, which
	displays the color, if its filled the static information (shape type), and the beginning and end of the document. The save feature 
	should be completed by the next day.
	Obstacles : I ran into the bug1, where files failed to generate/save text onto them, however after reviewing my notes and re-reading 
	my code, I realized I had failed to close the writer for the file. 
	
Nov 29, 2016
	Yesterday : I completed a large portion of the save function for the general output shared amongst shapes.
	Today     : I completed the save function such that it produces a file when saved that matches the desired style and requirements 
	for reading a file. All aspects are output that are required are sent as a text file. I also answered the 1st question in the float point 
	solution. I had explained with detail and examples the issue with the code.
	Obstacles : When writing the save file, there were issues with the output of the objects, which were easily solved. I also required a review
	of floating point numbers to understand what was occurring in the part 1 question 1, to located the issue.

Nov 30, 2016
	Yesterday : I completed the save functionality and answered the issue with the 7/11 problem.
	Today     : Small changes to the save command were made and the last question for the second problem's third question was answered. 
	I merged all of my completed functions and explanations to the master, as they were all completed and ready for deployment, and very 
	little work was done due to classes and other course work and education.
	Obstacles : I ran into issues with the third question, as the representation of the decimals needed to be rounded, which had to be 
	fixed, as there is only a finite binary representation for the infinite decimal representation.

Dec 1, 2016
	Yesterday : Finished save functionality, and explanations. Merged to master.
	Today     : Very little time was available today resulting in commenting and java docs. Reviewed code and debugged the 
	current version of the project. Tomorrow will attempt to find a better and faster solution to the second problem of the second question.
	Obstacles : No obstacles, but the second problem needs work.
